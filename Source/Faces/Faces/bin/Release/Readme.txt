If you are running on Linux, just download Seed.txt and Decoder.exe.
If you want to change the code to make it unreadable by me, just change the contents of Seed.txt, but be careful to keep the right format.
If you cock it up, download Seed again.

If you're on windows, you will also need the GtK installer, which you need to run (to install GtK # on windows). Then the Decoder.exe will also run on windows.

The 'Faces' binary is a little programme for Linux computers which have OpenCV installed(it's usually standard). It can be run from the desktop by double-clicking(unlike the Decoder, which in Linux needs to be run from the commmand line).
The programme displays live video from your computer and draws a box around any face it detects in the picture.
